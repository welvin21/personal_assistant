# Personal Assistant
This project aims to help people doing their daily life tasks. 

## Prerequisites

### Python
You need to have python installed on your local machine. Type ``` python --version ``` on your terminal to check if python is installed.
If python is installed, you must see something like ```Python x.x.x```. Otherwise, you can download [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) first.

### pip
pip is a python package manager. In order to run the code on your computer, you will need external modules. All these external modules/packages
can be installed easily using pip. Do ```pip --version``` on your terminal. If you encounter something like ```pip is not recognized as an internal or external command```,
feel free to follow the installation guide for [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

## Requirements
To install all external packages, use ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage
To run the code, go to the directory where main.py file is located. Type ```python main.py``` on your terminal, and the program should start.
